Week 1

I pretty much flew through all of the exercises with ease, and only had one that I was not confident with. I tried to use a loop to find an unwanted character, but I used the loop incorrectly and was over complicating my code. After checking with AI to see if my code was bug free or not, it suggested using the built in method "replace" instead.

week 2

For one of the problems, I was supposed to align 2 list indexes together and I didn't know how, so I asked ai how I could do that, and it gave me the built in method: insert. This makes sense because the problem mentioned the word insert twice.

week 3

The functions of this week's exercises weren't too complicated, I just had to search up how inserted worked. I also mainly only used chat gpt for coming up with the quick test runs after I completed my code.

week 4

This week was more rough for me because I did not come to lecture. I was on crutches this week and was not able to come. I had to learn what classes were using chat gbt. I had to experiment and kind of self teach using chat gbt for these problems. 

For exercise 10 I was sure that my code was right, but I was having a problem with the assert, so I was convinced that there was a bug in the assert? I was screen shotted and showed chat gbt and it told me to make the change to assert 3.9 <= avg 4.1

week 5

The exercises went smoothly but I had to search up what a tuple was using chat gpt and I was also confused between what property and setter was and how that influence the privacy levels of my variables. I also used AI on Project 1 to help me organize functions and ensured that my code would run correctly by using it to debug. We also used AI to generate the example runs for the functions.

week 6

I had to use AI on most of my problems for debugging purposes, and I was not in lecture so i did not know what static meant or how to use it and I had trouble combining classes from previous problems with my current one.

week 7

This week was better than the last, but it was still difficult to learn when to use previously shown classes in a problem. Just used AI to debug my code.
